# DROWSINESS_DETECTION
Drowsiness detection in an image using OpenCV, python and dlib. For detecting a blink we will be using EAR(Eye Aspect Ratio).
If the EAR indicates that the eyes have been closed for sufficiently large amount of time then an alarm will be played.

#BUILT ON:

i)Python

ii)OpenCV

iii)Dlib

#EXTERNAL LIBRARIES

i)Pre-trained HOG and Linear SVM object detector[For the task of facial detection]

ii)Dlib's facial landmark detector [68 (x,y)-coordinates that map to facial structures of the face]

iii)Eye Aspect Ratio[EAR equation for determining the blink]
